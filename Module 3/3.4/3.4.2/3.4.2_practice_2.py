"""
Slicing in both directions
==========================

You've seen slicing DataFrames by rows and by columns, but since DataFrames are two-dimensional objects, 
it is often natural to slice both dimensions at once. 
That is, by passing two arguments to .loc[], you can subset by rows and columns in one go.

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_srt is indexed by country and city, has a sorted index, and is available.

# region setup
import pandas as pd
temperatures = pd.read_csv('Module 3/data/temperatures.csv', index_col=0)
temperatures_ind = temperatures.set_index(["country", "city"])
temperatures_srt = temperatures_ind.sort_index()
