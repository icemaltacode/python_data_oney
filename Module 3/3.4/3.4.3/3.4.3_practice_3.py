Calculating on a pivot table
============================

Pivot tables are filled with summary statistics, but they are only a first step to finding 
something insightful. Often you'll need to perform further calculations on them. 
A common thing to do is to find the rows or columns where the highest or lowest value occurs.

Recall from Chapter 1 that you can easily subset a Series or DataFrame to find rows 
of interest using a logical condition inside of square brackets. 
For example: series[series > value].

pandas is loaded as pd and the DataFrame temp_by_country_city_vs_year is available. 

The .head() for this DataFrame is shown below, with only a few of the year columns displayed:

country 	    city 	    2000 	2001 	2002 	… 	2013
Afghanistan 	Kabul 	    15.823 	15.848 	15.715 	… 	16.206
Angola      	Luanda 	    24.410 	24.427 	24.791 	… 	24.554
Australia 	    Melbourne 	14.320 	14.180 	14.076 	… 	14.742
	            Sydney 	    17.567 	17.854 	17.734 	… 	18.090
Bangladesh 	    Dhaka 	    25.905 	25.931 	26.095 	… 	26.587
