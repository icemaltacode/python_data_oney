Using outer join to select actors
=================================

One cool aspect of using an outer join is that, because it returns all rows from both merged tables 
and null where they do not match, you can use it to find rows that do not have a match in the other 
table. To try for yourself, you have been given two tables with a list of actors from two popular 
movies: Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2. Most of the actors played in both movies. Use an outer join to 
find actors who did not act in both movies.

The Iron Man 1 table is called iron_1_actors, and Iron Man 2 table is called iron_2_actors.
Both tables have been loaded for you and a few rows printed so you can see the structure.
