Summarising dates
=================

Summary statistics can also be calculated on date columns that have values with the data type datetime64. 
Some summary statistics — like mean — don't make a ton of sense on dates, but others are super helpful, 
for example, minimum and maximum, which allow you to see what time range your data covers.
