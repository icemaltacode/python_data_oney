Dropping duplicates
===================

Summary statistics are exactly what they sound like - they summarize many numbers in one statistic. 
For example, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation are summary statistics. 
Calculating summary statistics allows you to get a better sense of your data, even if there's a lot of it.
