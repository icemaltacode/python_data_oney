"""
Pivoting on one variable
========================

Pivot tables are the standard way of aggregating data in spreadsheets.

In pandas, pivot tables are essentially another way of performing grouped calculations. 
That is, the .pivot_table() method is an alternative to .groupby().

In this exercise, you'll perform calculations using .pivot_table() to replicate the 
calculations you performed in the last lesson using .groupby().

sales is available and pandas is imported as pd.
