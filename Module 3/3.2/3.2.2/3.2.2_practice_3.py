Subsetting rows
===============

A large part of data science is about finding which bits of your dataset are interesting. 
One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. 
This is sometimes known as filtering rows or selecting rows.

There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational 
operators to return True or False for each row, then pass that inside square brackets.

dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 60]
dogs[dogs["color"] == "tan"]

You can filter for multiple conditions at once by using the "bitwise and" operator, &.

dogs[(dogs["height_cm"] > 60) & (dogs["color"] == "tan")]

homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.
