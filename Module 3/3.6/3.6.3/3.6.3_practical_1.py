Total riders in a month
=======================

Your goal is to find the total number of rides provided to passengers passing through the Wilson station
 (station_name == 'Wilson') when riding Chicago's public transportation system on weekdays 
 (day_type == 'Weekday') in July (month == 7). Luckily, Chicago provides this detailed data, but it is 
 in three different tables. You will work on merging these tables together to answer the question. 
 This data is different from the business related data you have seen so far, but all the information 
 you need to answer the question is provided.

The cal, ridership, and stations DataFrames have been loaded for you. The relationship between the
tables can be seen in the diagram below.
