Finding missing values
======================

Missing values are everywhere, and you don't want them interfering with your work. 
Some functions ignore missing data by default, but that's not always the behavior 
you might want. Some functions can't handle missing values at all, so these values 
need to be taken care of before you can use them. If you don't know where your missing 
values are, or if they exist, you could make mistakes in your analysis. 
In this exercise, you'll determine if there are missing values in the dataset, and if so, 
how many.

pandas has been imported as pd and avocados_2016, a subset of avocados that 
contains only sales from 2016, is available.
